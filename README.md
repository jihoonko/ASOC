# ASOC (Attentive Sparse Observation Combiner)

In this software, we provided the following implementations in PyTorch:

- Model and Dataset implementation (model.py and dataset.py): ASOC+ (DeepRaNE equipped with ASOC, 1x1 resolution) and ASOC (1x1 resolution) for precipitation nowcasting, and the dataset for each target task.
- Codes for experiments: Codes for fine-tuning the model, and evaluating the performance of the trained model.
